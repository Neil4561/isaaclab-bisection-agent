# Releasing

The project uses semantic versioning. Until the plugin and artifact contracts
stabilize, releases remain in the `0.x` series.

## Release checklist

1. Run linting and the complete CPU-only test suite.
2. Build the wheel and install it into a fresh virtual environment.
3. Build the Docker image for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
4. Run a synthetic bisection from the installed console command.
5. Run a short `docker-reconstruct` range on a supported GPU host.
6. Verify `report.md`, `summary.json`, `probe_range.json`, and attempt artifacts.
7. Confirm `security_scan.json` passes and Security CI reports no unresolved
   High/Critical dependency or container vulnerability.
8. For NVIDIA deployment, attach current nSpect vulnerability, secret, and
   malware evidence; confirm PLC/TAVA/cards/testing/portal gates are complete.
9. Confirm all documented compatibility and security limits remain accurate.
10. Obtain human release approval, then tag the exact tested commit as
    `v<version>`.

The tag workflow publishes:

- `ghcr.io/<owner>/isaaclab-bisection-agent:<version>`
- `ghcr.io/<owner>/isaaclab-bisection-agent:latest`

Production automation should pin the immutable image digest, not `latest`.
The `release` GitHub environment must require a human reviewer before the tag
workflow can publish.

## Clean-clone acceptance

Before announcing a release to other developers, validate from a new clone on a
host that does not have the source checkout on `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
python -m venv /tmp/isaaclab-bisect-release
source /tmp/isaaclab-bisect-release/bin/activate
python -m pip install .
isaaclab-bisect --help
```

Then run one synthetic workflow and one Docker reconstruction smoke test against
an explicitly supplied `--repo_root`.
